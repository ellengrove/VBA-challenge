# VBA Challenge

Data and Software:

  This script was written for Visual Basic and utilizes data contained within an excel workbook. Excel must be installed.  

Functionality:

  This VBA script reads daily stock data for the years 2018-2020 and summarizes the total annual trade volume by ticker, as well as the change in price (from market open on the first trading date of the year, through market close on the last trading date of the year) in dollars and percentage return. For each year, a second summary table displays the security that demonstrated the greatest percent price increase, the greatest percent price decrease, and the greatest annual trade volume. Conditional formatting illustrates overall negative or positive price movements. This script reads data in three separate tabs corresponding to each year and contains each year's results within that same tab.
